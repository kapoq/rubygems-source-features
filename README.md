rubygems-source-features
========================

These features cover the basic API of a Rubygems gem source:

* GET gem indices
* GET gemspecs
* GET gem (well duh)
* POST create new gem (gem push)
* DELETE delete gem version (gem yank)

For an example implementation, see [rubygems-source](https://github.com/kapoq/rubygems-source).
